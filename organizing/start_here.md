# Supporting PyLadies Berlin

We heard you want to support our community ❤️ First and foremost thank you! We can not achieve our goal of making the Python community more diverse without folks like you.

This document is set up in the style of a choose your own adventure, it's purpose is to help you discover how you can support our community, be that by hosting an event, giving a workshop or talk, mentorship, handling sponsorships, everything in between or something completely new. If you prefer a more structured table of contents please see [below](#organizing-resources) or check our [FAQ](faq.md).

Because all events are unique and so are all organizers we try to cover different ways you can get involved so you can choose what works best for you. We also aim to answer questions we have received frequently to give you an idea of what this involves.

As this is an evolving document, it is not complete, so if you think something is missing please open an issue on the repository so we can help you and others.
