## Hosting PyLadies

One way many companies support the community by hosting our events. If you are interested to host us please fill in the following [form](https://forms.gle/XdtKq865dqqW3fCD9), which allows us to collect the relevant information and pair you with an upcoming event (note this might take some time depending on the current schedule). If you need more information or perhaps need something to persuade your employer to host us you can check the information below.

### Why host a PyLadies event

By sponsoring one of our events as a host, you are not only promoting Python development and diversity in tech, you can meet and talk to Python developers and enthusiasts. Our Meetups are a great opportunity to present your company, products and services to an interested audience, as well as find talented developers for your team.

### Regular Meetups

We run meetups once a month on the second Tuesday of the month in the evening (7-10pm) These have various themes and cover beginner to advanced topics. We also occasionally run longer events on weekends that allow us to go into topics deeper.

### Requirements from hosting companies

The exact requirements will depend on the event, however below gives you an idea of what we require:

 * projector
 * microphone for speakers
 * chairs
 * if workshop/code along sessions: tables and electricity for participants
 * food and drinks (if possible)

### Code of Conduct

Every person involved in our events should comply with our [Code of Conduct](https://www.pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct/).

### Job Postings

We have a slack channel for job posts; you can join our slack [here](TODO add link)

### Company speaker(s)

We normally reserve a 5-10 minutes slot after our introduction for a host/sponsor presentation. Speakers should check out our [speakers guide](./speakers_guide.md). Note that:
   - Audience level may vary significantly and there will be folks at all stages of their career 
   - We therefore ak that you assume no prior knowledge but infinite intelligence.
   - Consider "folks" instead of "guys" and try to use other inclusive language (find more examples in our speaker guide)
   - We  know it can be hard, especially for an expert, to present something to an audience without prior knowledge, so we would like to offer to give feedback on slides or support the speaker if they have any questions. To organize this please send us an [email](mailto:berlin@pyladies). 


## Sponsoring PyLadies

If you are a company as well or instead of hosting us you might consider sponsoring us in other ways. Below are the types of sponsorship we have either had in the past or looking for, but if you have another idea in mind please drop us an [email](mailto:berlin@pyladies).

### Branded swag

Currently we are looking for funding to buy swag that we can compensate our speakers and community leaders with. For example we have previous received funding for T-shirts, Tote Bags. When ordering swag we preference organic cotton and fair trade as these match our values of a fairer and more sustainable future.

### Childcare

For some events (particularly those at weekends) we aim to provide child care options to support the participation of parents. This can cost around 500 EUR. As we don't have any form of income or donations we rely on companies to sponsor this for specific events. If you think you would be able to make a cover this for an upcoming event regardless of if yu plan to host the event) please send us a [email](mailto:berlin@pyladies)

### Monetary Donations

At the moment as we have no community bank account it is easiest if the company sponsoring handles the invoice entirely. If this is not possible we can ask the PSV for support to handle the transfer for us.

### Resource Donations

We have also received and welcome donations of books and software licenses which we can then raffle within the community. 

### Conference Tickets

Please see our documentation on conferences [here](./conference.md)

### What we can offer in return

We are deeply grateful to those who have sponsored us already and that it means we can reward and thank those who make our community so special as well as contribute to our goal of making the space more inclusive.

In return for your sponsorship we will add your logo to our website on the sponsors page (still to be implemented), and give you a shout out on our social media. If the sponsorship is for swag we can make it co-branded (ie have your logo also on it) and if the sponsorship goes towards a specific event we will advertise it at the event and invite you to come introduce the company in a 5 minute slot at the start.
