### Meetup

Our meetup is paid for by the PSF. A community member is required to be the main organizer, this may require them to add their credit card details but should not result in them being charged. Other members can be given different roles, which gives them different access rights such as being a co-organizer, event organizer etc In general we are not using these roles strictly but they may be useful to allow folks to create Meetup events.

### Slack

The Slack is owned by the global PyLadies group, we have several channels and can also create new ones (which can be later archived) for example to organize specific events.

There is a private channel called #organizers which has organizers from all the different chapters, mostly resources are shared in open channels but this can be useful for topics with a sensitive subject. If you want to be added please request this in the #city-berlin-events-organisation channel or raise it at one of our [Berlin chapter org meetings](./supporting_pyladies.md#monthly-org-meetings)

#### Integrations

We have a number of integrations in slack
- [Zapier](TODO add link)
	This allows us to post our tweets in slack automatically as well as sending them to our Facebook group. It can also be used to automate other such interactions, however we only use the free version which limits how many "zaps" we can set up.
- [Workflows](TODO add link)
	Workflows in slack are useful for guiding members to different resources and collecting information. We have a couple of workflows set up for when members join certain channels and also for creating events. They can be created and updated in the slack settings.
- [2FA](TODO add link)
	Our 2FA account uses Telynx to post in slack. [Read more on our 2FA](./accounts.md#2fa)


### Twitter

***Note that currently all tweets will also be posted in the slack channel #city-berlin and to our Facebook group.***
