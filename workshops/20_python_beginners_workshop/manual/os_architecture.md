# Shall I choose 32-Bit or 64-Bit installer?

## macOS

Note: Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is the last release that a 32-bit Intel Mac can run, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and up are, by default, 64-bit.

Launch "System Information" (or "System Profiler" on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard) and click on the Software heading in the Contents section. The line 64-bit Kernel and Extensions will say Yes if you are running the 64-bit kernel and No if you are running the 32-bit kernel.
